## Introduction
There is a demo project that does face following with a fan:

My first usage will be to add face following to my Skull Project https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/Skull-Project. We want to make the eyes follow the face detected by the Vision-AI V2.

The Skull Project uses eyes made from Adafruit HalloWing M4 Express. These use the SAMD51 processor (ATSAMD51G18).

Because the Skull Project eyes are pretty busy just displaying the eyes, I don't want to interrupt them at random times with an I2C or UART message. Thus I plan to output the position information on two ESP32-C3 Analog channels, and the SAMD51 in the eyes can sample the information at any convenient time that doesn't interrupt its processing.
